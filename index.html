        <p>The Sea Slug is found worldwide in all parts of the ocean, although their greatest area of diversity lies in the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean. In fact, over 1,000 species of nudibranchs have been found and documented in the Philippines alone, with some of them even being new to science! They are commonly found just below the low tide line, creeping along the bottom or clinging to submerged vegetation, although members of a few species have been found to swim at the surface of the open ocean, in the middle of nowhere.</p>

        <p>Sea Slugs, as they are apart of the Mollusk grouping, shed their shells soon after their larval stage of life. Some Sea Slugs are deadly poisonous, and often get such toxins from the food that they catch and eat. Others incorporate the colors of their environments into their own as camouflage. Another name for this behavior is cryptic coloration, or crypsis.<br> <br>Sea slugs are Hermaphrodites, meaning they can be both male and female at will, since they have both reproductive organs in their systems. They’ll shoot their eggs out in sticky, ribbon-like strings, then fertilize them and be on their way.

        <h3>Behavior</h3>
            
        <p>Most Sea Slugs are bottom feeders, meaning that they stick to staying at the bottom of the waters they’re living in and eating whatever falls to the bottom of the ocean. Their diets mostly consist of plankton and decaying matter found at the bottom of the ocean.<br> <br>Observations done in laboratories on this creatures navigational senses are amongst the most exciting findings by scientists, mostly because beforehand people had just assumed that sea slugs were just inching around randomly about on the sea floor. They use these navigational senses in a variety of different creative ways, including hitching a ride on passing water currents to escape from potential threats.

        <h3>Relationship with Humans</h3>
        
        <p>Sea Slugs have long been an essential tool for scientists to study and discover ways to improve human memory. The genes within a sea slugs brain also correlate with those of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Sea slugs have roughly just 20,000 neurons, a meager handful compared to the human brain's 100 billion. Their neurons, however, are larger in size compared to ours, making them ideal for brain research. </p>
